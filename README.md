# speedboard

SpeedBoard is a simple speed dial app I first wrote in 2020 for my grandparents. Moving from feature phones to smartphones was overwhelming for them. What used to be two steps to make a call—dial a number, press call—suddenly turned into five.

I wanted to bring back the simplicity of speed dial for the smartphone era. SpeedBoard lets you call or text your close friends and family in just two steps: unlock, tap a face. No scrolling, no searching, no reading.

I built it as my first real project in SwiftUI and the Swift Composable Architecture, and it taught me a lot about functional programming and building apps that are both simple and composable. It’s designed to be accessible, intuitive, and focused on one thing only: making it easier to reach the people who matter most.

This app was free, and it will always be free. For as long as it’s reasonable, I’ll keep maintaining it for its users.
